"""The worker image has no HTTP stack — pin that the worker never needs one.

`Dockerfile.worker` installs `requirements/worker.txt`: base.txt plus the
numerical stack, and deliberately no fastapi, no uvicorn, no starlette. That
separation is the only reason a second Dockerfile exists.

Its cost is that the constraint is invisible while developing, where `.venv` has
everything installed. An import added under `worker/` that reaches the API layer
type-checks, lints, and passes every test — then crash-loops the container.

Which is exactly what happened: the overdue scheduler shipped importing
`api.billing.deps` for two provider functions, and `billing-worker` restarted 60+
times in dev without the daily sweep ever running once. Nothing caught it, because
nothing here had ever asserted what the image contains.

Two failure modes, one assertion each:

1. the worker reaches a module importing something the image does not install;
2. the worker reaches a first-party package `Dockerfile.worker` does not COPY —
   administrative-document's half of the same bug (`No module named 'api'`), which
   no import check can see, because the package is present locally.

Both need a subprocess: this pytest process has fastapi loaded already, and the
graph is only visible on a from-scratch import.
