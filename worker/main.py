"""Worker process entry point.

Bootstraps logging + tracing, connects to NATS JetStream (which ensures the
billing streams exist), subscribes the durable billing consumers, and runs
until SIGINT/SIGTERM — then drains in-flight work and disposes resources
cleanly. Unlike the simulation template this worker is DB/IO-bound, so there is
no solver process pool.

Run locally:

    python -m worker.main
